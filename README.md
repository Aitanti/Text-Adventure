My game will be based on the Science Fiction genre set in the year 2244 – The Human race has finally been able to set aside their conflicts and have become one with all of earth’s governments creating the Earth Republic, with planet sized central government. – with this happening the technology of the Human Race has reached unthinkable level’s advance AI control the vast amounts of Space Freighters and keeps the trade following throughout the Sol System, Space Travel within the Sol System has been mastered, the finest minds are now working on an FTL Drive so the human race can expand into the greater milky way.

Mars has finally been colonised and now has generations of Humans living on it within the domed cities – those cannot afford the beauty of Earth now call mars their home, Mars is known for its manufacturing, engineering, ship design, Humans on mars are called Hulama, this is the Evenki word for red – which represents the Red Planet, The Evenki are a hard nomad race of people which the Mars feels like they have a connection with.

Earth has become a Sanctuary for the Rich and Powerful – holding all of the greatest minds and the most impressive Technology, the technology on Earth is so great that it is believed that Earth is years ahead of Mars and the rest of the sol system.

The once working class is now throughout the Sol System working on the asteroid belts mining the precious resources the galaxy has provided for the Human Empire – they work in dangerous ship factories, which are all ran by giant corporations, with Humans living throughout the Sol System on Space stations, Factory Ships, Moon Colonies and asteroid mining belts – these humans are now known as Belters or Dusters, they live in all types of conditions, numbered in the billions, some never leaving the vast factory ships, and some are even third and fourth generation on these factory ships.

With the high number of Belters in the Sol System, the mining corporations take advantage of this, making life cheap, belters work long hours thanks to medical advancement the humans can now work more and sleep less – if you don’t work you are easily replaced, it is a dark time for the belters and dusters.

The game start’s you wake up in familiar location your small apartment, which is part of the Talon Corp Station 5 which sits just above Saturn’s Moon of Titan, you are one of thousands on this station, you have a small room which holds all of your processions, the room lights up, the time on the station says 3am, you get changed into your exo suit, grab some nutrients and you walk out the door, from there the adventure begins.

The game will give the user man decisions to make with many different outcomes, my idea of this game and has been in my mind for awhile the ideas come from many of the science fiction books I have read in the past.

I want to have a map, inventory system a few levels to interact with and a few npc's that you can interact with there will also be times in the game where you can one other can work together to overcome some objects, you wont always have to have someone else to help you but you can have this option.

This game will also have many different levels/rooms/zones the lore will be getting an update soon, I am currently writing it onto paper.
